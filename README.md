# Golang Assessment Test

This is a small test willing to evaluate your Golang programming skills.

It consists of three small tasks. Subjects covered are:

- Go concurrency
- APIs
- and unit testing / mocking.

This is not a strict pass/fail situation. If your code does not run, or if the result is not perfect, it's not
necessarily bad news for you.

#### Some advice:

- We want to get an idea of your "programming philosophy" and your way of thinking in general. So, try to behave as if
  you were writing code calmly at work, or -even better- for a project of your own at your free time.
- The amount of time that you are given is irrelevant (the maximum allowed by this platform). If you feel that you have
  finished everything but there much time left, it's not necessary that you have missed something!
- Feel free to search the internet if needed. Literally no one is coding without googling at the same time!
- Don't be afraid to use "trial and error" method. We tried to fulfill our initial code with verbose and descriptive
  error messages. This might be helpful for you.
- Try to work on this platform as much as you can. Not only the final result, but your progress on reaching this result
  is useful for us as well.

Good luck!
